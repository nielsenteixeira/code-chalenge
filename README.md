# code-chalenge

Since becoming a manager, I've had very little hands-on with the code. The idea of this project is to solve some coding challenges to keep my programming skills active.

Solved Challenges:

* [Two Sum](https://github.com/nielsenteixeira/code-challenge/tree/main/src/TwoSum)
* [ValidParentheses](https://github.com/nielsenteixeira/code-challenge/tree/main/src/ValidParentheses)
